"A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.","A comprehensive study of massive photon pair production in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has been performed, taking into account all relevant next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from various subprocesses, including quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon interactions. Additionally, an all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation has been incorporated, ensuring high accuracy at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level. The calculated results have been found to be in good agreement with experimental data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions have been made for further testing with CDF and DO data. Furthermore, predictions for diphoton pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have been provided, allowing for a comparison between the signals of a hypothetical Higgs boson decay and QCD processes at the LHC. By carefully selecting event samples, the study demonstrates how the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal can be improved.",9,
"We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson.","We introduce a novel algorithm called the $(k, \ell)$-pebble game with colors, which enables us to comprehensively describe the family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs and devise efficient solutions for related tree decomposition problems. Sparse graphs have been gaining traction in recent years, especially in rigidity theory, making our work particularly relevant. Notably, our approach enhances and generalizes previous research by Lee and Streinu, providing a fresh perspective on the classic Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. Additionally, we develop a new decomposition technique that relies on the $(k, \ell)$-pebble game with colors to verify sparsity. Our findings also reveal intriguing links between pebble game algorithms and earlier works by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann, as well as Hendrickson, further enriching the field of sparse graph theory.",10,
"The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).","The Earth-Moon system's development is consistent with the dark matter field fluid model presented at the 2004 American Physical Society's Division of Particle and Field meeting. The model accurately describes the Moon's current behavior and its overall evolutionary pattern, which correlates well with geological and fossil records. Notably, the Moon was once only 259,000 kilometers away from Earth around 4.5 billion years ago—well beyond Roche's limit. These findings suggest that tidal friction might not have been the main driver of the Earth-Moon system's evolution. In addition, the study yielded a constant for the average dark matter field fluid of approximately 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1) m^(-1), which predicts that Mars' rotation is decelerating with an angular acceleration rate of around -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).",10,
We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the determinant.,"We demonstrate that a specific quantity known as the determinant of Stirling cycle numbers is actually a counter for unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. Our proof utilizes a clever mapping between these automata and certain pathways in a lattice, along with a technique called sign-reversing involution to calculate the value of the determinant.",10,
"In this paper we show how to compute the $\\Lambda_{\\alpha}$ norm, $\\alpha\\ge 0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.","In this study, we demonstrate how to calculate the $\\Lambda_{\\alpha}$ norm, where $\\alpha$ is non-negative, by utilizing the dyadic grid. This achievement stems from our understanding of the relationship between the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ and both dyadic and special atoms.",10,
"We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \\ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.","In this study, we investigate the two-particle wave function of pairs of atoms in a Fermi gas whose interactions can be adjusted using Feshbach resonance. We focus on the Cooper pair wave function and examine its bosonic characteristics by analyzing the Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation of composite particles. To illustrate our findings, we consider a three-dimensional uniform gas and compare two different definitions of the Cooper pair wave function. One definition is chosen to capture the off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO), while the other corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. Our results show that, for negative scattering lengths, the ODLRO definition leads to a more bosonic behavior compared to the pair-projected definition. Additionally, we find that both definitions yield similar results when the inverse of the Fermi momentum ($(k_F a)^{-1}$) is greater than or equal to 1, indicating that over 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.",9,
"A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model.","The polymer representation of quantum mechanics, a less conventional interpretation of the canonical commutation relations, has garnered attention in recent years for its potential connection to Planck scale physics. This approach has been explored in the context of loop quantum gravity, specifically within the realm of loop quantum cosmology. Our study delves into the relationship between traditional Schrödinger theory and the polymer description. The paper consists of two main sections. Firstly, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics from the standard Schrödinger theory and demonstrate how the polymer picture emerges as an appropriate limit. In the second part, we examine the continuum limit of this theory by attempting to retrieve classical Schrödinger quantum mechanics from the discrete theory. We investigate various examples, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle, and a simplified cosmological model.",8,
"A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.","A universal approach was created to describe material behavior under dynamic loading conditions. This involved developing numerical techniques to compute responses to shock and ramp compressions, as well as ramp decompressions. These methods were successful in extending earlier solutions for scalar equations of state and demonstrated great adaptability and reliability. They also showed excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The basic techniques for ramp and shock solutions were combined to model complex deformation processes, including shock-induced impacts and interactions between various materials at an interface. These computations effectively captured the essence of material dynamics experiments while eliminating the need for detailed spatial simulations. Sample calculations using metals illustrated how plastic work affects temperature changes during quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, as well as the influence of a phase transformation.",9,
"We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set.","We examine the outcomes of the joint IRAC and MIPS Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region, focusing on identifying genuine young stellar objects (YSOs) amidst the abundant background contamination from extragalactic objects. We establish a set of criteria to separate YSOs from the latter and explore the characteristics of the remaining high-confidence YSO sample. Within the 0.85 square degree area covered by both IRAC and MIPS, we identify 235 YSOs, while an additional 51 lower-confidence YSOs are found outside this region using MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. Our study produces two main sets of results: color-color diagrams comparing our observed source properties with theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems, and our own modeling of a subset of YSOs that display properties consistent with star+disk systems. These objects reveal a diverse range of disk properties, including actively accreting disks, passive disks, and potentially debris disks. The luminosity function of YSOs in Serpens extends down to around a few times 0.001 solar luminosities, assuming a distance of 260 parsecs. However, this lower limit might be influenced by our inability to differentiate YSOs from extragalactic sources rather than the actual absence of YSOs at very low luminosities. Furthermore, we perform a spatial clustering analysis that indicates that the less evolved YSOs are more densely grouped compared to their more advanced counterparts, and demonstrate that the background extragalactic population follows the same two-point correlation function as observed in other studies. Finally, we provide a table matching various previous infrared and X-ray investigations of the Serpens YSO population with our Spitzer dataset.",6,
"Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.","Partial cubes are subgraphs of hypercubes that share the same symmetries and properties as their parent structure. Semicubes, which are formed by combining smaller cubes, are used to define structures on a graph. Two important concepts in the study of partial cubes are Djokovi's and Winkler's relations. Researchers use these ideas to better understand the characteristics of bipartite graphs and partial cubes with varying dimensionality. This knowledge allows for the development of novel approaches to identifying and categorizing such graphs.",5,
"The research involves creating new partial cubes through the combination of existing ones using techniques like the Cartesian product and pasting, or expanding and contracting them.

"In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field $\\Q(\\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.","This paper proposes a method for determining the Hecke eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors (Hecke eigensystems) of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields with narrow class number one.

"Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_f(n)q ^n \\in S_{\\lambda+1/2}(\\Gamma_0(N),\\chi)\\cap \\mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of half integral weight for primes $p \\geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\\geq5$, of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions.","Recently, Bruinier and Ono demonstrated that there exist cusp forms $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_f(n) q^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that do not possess a specific distribution property for odd prime moduli $p$. Building upon their work, we utilize the Rankin-Cohen Bracket to broaden this result by incorporating modular forms of half-integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. Our primary theorem yields distribution properties for traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class numbers modulo such primes $p \geq 5$. Additionally, we explore an analogue of Newman's conjecture pertaining to overpartitions.",9,
"Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.","Serre previously showed that the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ exists for $p=2,3,5,7$. This paper extends Serre's result to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$, using linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. The proof leads to various consequences, including congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotients of Eisenstein series, and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a specific point. Additionally, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass space can be derived through Ikeda lifting.",10,

This relationship is examined through the lens of the theory of Chen's iterated integrals, which provides a framework for understanding the interaction between string topology and differential forms. The cyclic bar complex, a tool from algebraic topology, also plays a crucial role in elucidating this connection. By delving into these concepts, the article sheds light on the intricate ties between string topology and differential forms.",5,
"The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond states.",The ten-dimensional superstring theory's pure spinor formulation yields supersymmetric loop amplitude expressions that are straightforwardly integrated in a superspace with only spinor coordinates. This research investigates various techniques for evaluating such integrals and applies them to determine the kinematic coefficients of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point functions involving two or four Ramond particles.,9,
"In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored.","In this study, we investigate the lifetime of three doubly charmed baryons, specifically $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We thoroughly examine the non-spectator contributions at the quark level, taking into account Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams. To estimate the hadronic matrix elements, we employ a simplified non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our findings are largely consistent with previous studies that utilized the diquark model. However, our theoretical predictions for the lifetimes are significantly higher than the upper limit established by the latest SELEX measurement. This disparity can only be resolved through future experiments that provide more precise data. If the SELEX collaboration's value is confirmed, it will indicate the presence of an unexplored mechanism.",10,
"Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.","Observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya during periods of quiescence in 1991 and 2001 have yielded new insights into the system's accretion dynamics. For the first time, spin-modulated radial velocities indicative of an outer disk origin were detected in an IP, with velocities ranging from approximately 500-600 km/s. This suggests that the accretion curtain is corotating with material at the outer edge of the disk, near the Roche lobe radius. Additionally, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed emissions from the accretion curtain spanning velocities of 500 km/s to 1000 km/s, supporting the idea of a large accretion curtain extending close to the Roche lobe radius. Further, evidence of an overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was found, consistent with previous studies. The origins of the spin radial velocities were found to be diverse, with hbeta and hgamma velocities originating from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while halpha velocities were produced by material flowing along field lines both far from and close to the white dwarf. These results align with the accretion curtain model and provide further support for the theories proposed by King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002), and Norton et al. (2004).",7,
"We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions.

"The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations.

Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop.

"We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.","We propose a method for solving nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-commutative vector fields, which describe the evolution of a system on a smooth, finite-dimensional manifold. Our approach leverages the theory of Lie groups and their actions on manifolds. Specifically, given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we first pull back the SDE's flow on the manifold to the Lie group through this action. Then, we apply the exponential map to pull back the flow to the Lie algebra. By performing closed operations in the Lie algebra, we obtain an approximated version of the stochastic flow, which is then pushed forward to the Lie group and finally to the original manifold. This process ensures that our approximation stays within the manifold. We refer to these methods as stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods, named after their deterministic counterparts. Additionally, we explore stochastic Lie group integration schemes inspired by Castell--Gaines methods. These approaches rely on approximating the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series using an underlying ordinary differential integrator. When utilizing Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying integrator, they become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes.

To illustrate our techniques, we simulate the behavior of a free rigid body (e.g., a satellite or an autonomous underwater vehicle) subject to two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.",9,
"The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of the comprehensive dynamic simulations.","Despite extensive research, the structure and behavior of the solar chromosphere remain poorly understood. However, observations at millimeter wavelengths offer a promising way to address this issue. Sophisticated dynamic models, such as those developed by Carlsson and Stein, suggest that these wavelengths are highly sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere. Specifically, the most informative wavelengths lie between 0.8 and 5.0 millimeters. These observations can potentially distinguish between competing models of the solar atmosphere, thanks to their ability to detect both hot and cool gas. Preliminary data from the BIMA array, which has a resolution of 12 arcseconds, has already revealed notable oscillations with temperatures ranging from 50 to 150 Kelvin and frequencies spanning 1.5 to 8 megahertz, with shorter periods observed in internetwork areas and longer periods in network regions. Nonetheless, higher spatial resolution, such as what ALMA offers, is necessary to clearly separate features within the solar atmosphere and compare them effectively with simulation outputs.",6,
"The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.","The formation of two-dimensional spin-wave waveforms in long, thin strips of ferromagnetic material has been studied using advanced techniques that allow us to observe changes in the magnetic field over time and space. When the magnetic field is applied lengthwise along the strip, we find that the strength of the dynamic magnetization weakens near the edges of the strip. This phenomenon is known as effective dipolar pinning"" and occurs because the magnetic moments at the edges are directed perpendicular to the strip's long axis.",6,
"When we increase the input power, we enter a nonlinear regime where a novel type of spin wave emerges. These waves travel along the length of the strip and are shaped by the narrow confines of the waveguide. We have observed that the waveform's stability and interactions with the surrounding walls play an essential role in determining its properties. Our experimental results agree well with computer simulations, providing valuable insights into how confinement affects the behavior of these exotic waves.""",,0,

"We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and (-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes.","In graphene, we observe an unusual phenomenon where the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point exhibits a distinctive fine structure when it resonates with certain inter-Landau-level transitions. This occurs when the lattice mode associated with the G-band in the Raman spectrum is in resonance with transitions between energy levels 0 and (+,1), as well as (-,1) and 0, at a specific magnetic field strength of approximately 30 T. By studying this effect, researchers can directly measure the strength of the electron-phonon interaction. Additionally, the dependence of this phenomenon on filling factor allows for the experimental detection of circularly polarized lattice modes.",7,
We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants and permanents of positive semi-definite matrices.

"We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement","We examine how adjusting the phonon energy affects correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Our investigation reveals various intriguing phenomena when itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon couplings, and static deformations operate on comparable energy scales. Specifically, we observe a transition from band-like to Mott behavior in the spectral function at moderate phonon frequencies, resulting in unique hybrid band/Mott characteristics. This crossover significantly impacts the optical conductivity, making it potentially detectable via its low-frequency profile. Additionally, our study shows that the resistivity exhibits a distinctive double Kondo peak structure.",8,
"We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.","Our research demonstrates that a crystal can effectively confine and guide a wide range of particle distributions, including their position and momentum coordinates, while maintaining a high level of precision. By using a curved crystal, this distributed particle population can be directed towards further analysis. In simulated experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, we found that our specially designed crystal was able to capture 90% of the protons that were deflected through large angles, which is 100 times greater than the critical angle, resulting in an improvement in efficiency of up to 100 fold. Additionally, we showed that the crystal preserves the angles of transmitted protons with an accuracy of less than 0.1 microradians, making it possible to use crystals for measuring extremely forward protons at the LHC.",5,
"We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through modulation effects in the $\\bar\ u_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible detectability of the neutronization $\ u_e$ burst. We find that the $\\bar\ u_e$ spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\\times 10^{-5}$.","In this study, we investigate the potential for observing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) during a future galactic supernova (SN) using a Megaton water Cherenkov detector. Specifically, we focus on how NSI affects the propagation of neutrinos through the SN envelope, taking into account the possibility of resonant conversions that may occur in the innermost, deleptonized regions. We examine three different ways to detect NSI effects in the detector: modulations in the electron antineutrino spectrum caused by shock waves passing through the envelope, time variations in the electron fraction, and Earth matter effects; as well as the potential detection of a neutronization burst. Our results show that the electron antineutrino spectrum can display striking features resulting from internal NSI-induced resonant conversion, particularly for non-universal NSI strengths of a few percent and very small flavor-changing NSI above a few times $10^{-5}$.",8,
"We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers. Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.","Our study thoroughly examined the accuracy of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) through a detailed theoretical analysis. We demonstrated that the error in any calculated quantity is limited to a combination of linear and squared terms related to the dipole's size, providing DDA remains applicable. Notably, the linear component is substantially reduced for cube-shaped objects compared to other shapes. As a result, errors for small dipoles are considerably lower for cubic particles. Furthermore, as the size increases, the significance of the linear term diminishes, resulting in a generally quadratic rate of convergence for larger dipoles within the typical range. To substantiate our findings, extensive numerical experiments spanning various sizes were conducted. Lastly, we discussed novel advancements in DDA and their implications on its convergence behavior.",8,

"We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.","Our approach enhances the precision of discrete dipole approximation calculations by employing an innovative extrapolation technique. Through comprehensive simulations across five diverse scenarios, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method using various discretizations. Notably, when applied to cubic-shaped particles, our technique yielded remarkable results, exhibiting a remarkable reduction in error by nearly two orders of magnitude. Additionally, we developed estimators for predicting extrapolation errors, which proved to be dependable. To further facilitate error analysis, we devised a straightforward approach to differentiate between shape and discretization errors. This novel technique was successfully demonstrated through its application to one of the test cases.",9,
"The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.","The repeated use of the multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle in cell signaling allows for various dynamic behaviors, such as bistability and ultrasensitivity, to occur without direct positive feedback loops. In this study, we investigate the impact of altering biological parameters on the number of stable states in a generalized multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. Our findings reveal that within certain parameter ranges, the number of stable states increases with the number of sites being modified, while never exceeding 2n-1 states. Notably, when considering systems with two levels of modification (n=2), we discover that there exist no more than three stable states. Furthermore, our analysis shows that under typical Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, the number of stable states does not surpass n+1, whereas for parameters significantly deviating from these conditions, only one stable state remains.",9,
"In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.","In this study, we explore the potential of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to model the scattering of light by particles that are significantly larger than the wavelength of the incident light.

Our numerical experiments involve simulating light scattering by spheres with size parameters up to 160 and 40 for refractive indices of 1.05 and 2, respectively, and comparing the results with those obtained using the exact Mie theory. We find that errors in both integrated and angle-resolved scattering quantities tend to increase with the refractive index, while showing no consistent trend with particle size. Notably, computational time increases sharply with both particle size and refractive index, requiring over two weeks of processing power on a 64-processor cluster. A key feature of our computer program is its ability to distribute a single DDA simulation across multiple processors, enabling the simulation of light scattering by extremely large particles. However, there are still limitations to the current approach, and we discuss potential avenues for improvement.",7,

"""The quadratic pion scalar radius, \\la r^2\a^\\pi_s, plays an important role for present precise determinations of \\pi\\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\\'ain, using an Omn\\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar form factor, obtains \\la r^2\a^\\pi_s=0.75\\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es equations, \\la r^2\a^\\pi_s=0.61\\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\\'ain's method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input \\pi\\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is \\la r^2\a_s^\\pi=0.65\\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 \\pi\\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD.","The quadratic pion scalar radius, which refers to the square of the distance between the quark and antiquark within a pion, has significant implications for the accurate study of pion-pion scattering. In recent times, researcher Yndurain utilized an Omnes representation of the null isospin (I) non-strange pion scalar form factor to determine the value of this radius, obtaining a result of approximately 0.75 ± 0.07 femtometer squared (fm^2). However, this value was found to be inconsistent with the value obtained through the solution of the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omnes equations, which yielded a value of around 0.61 ± 0.04 fm^2. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the initial result. To address this issue, we conducted a reevaluation of Yndurain's approach, incorporating the requirement of continuity in the resulting pion scalar form factor when there are minor variations in the input pi-pi phase shifts. By doing so, we discovered that a zero in the form factor becomes necessary for certain S-wave I=0 T-matrices. When this constraint is taken into account, the derived value of the quadratic pion scalar radius turns out to be approximately 0.65 ± 0.05 fm^2. The primary source of uncertainty in this determination stems from current experimental uncertainties in low-energy S-wave I=0 pi-pi phase shifts. Additionally, the not-yet-settled nature of the asymptotic behavior of the phase of the scalar form factor from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) contributes significantly to the overall error margin.",,
"We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions.

"Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems.

"Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.","Potassium's ability to insert itself into graphite is looked at using first-principles theory. Traditional semi-local density functional theory (DFT) calculations do a good job of explaining the bonding in the potassium-graphite compound. But to figure out how much energy it takes to make an intercalate from pure potassium atoms and graphite, you need a way to describe the binding between the graphite layers that includes non-local dispersive interactions. A van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method does this without any problems and includes these interactions in a natural way along with regular DFT. Using the vdW-DF method makes the graphite crystal more stable, which agrees fairly well with what has been seen in real life. They also say that things like the distance between bindings, the energy it takes to form a layer, and the amount of energy it takes to put potassium under the surface are all affected by the vdW-DF description. Compared to the traditional semilocal approach, the vdW-DF description makes the elastic response less strong.",7,

"I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.","The possibility that intelligent life exists abundantly throughout the cosmos will be challenged by offering three compelling arguments to the contrary. We'll begin with the collective viewpoint of influential figures like Simpson, Dobzhansky, and Mayr, who assert that the development of sophisticated life forms is highly implausible from an evolutionary standpoint. Then we'll delve into the Fermi Paradox, which questions why, given their presumed existence, advanced civilizations haven't yet made contact or revealed themselves. Moving on, we'll demonstrate how the widespread presence of intelligent life would lead to resource depletion and eventual extinction. However, we'll also explore how the quantum mechanical concept of unitarity – which has teleological aspects – necessitates the long-term survival of intelligent life. Lastly, we'll propose that the observed acceleration of the universe can only be explained by an imbalance of matter and antimatter, and that this, in turn, suggests the emergence of intelligent life multiple times within our observable universe. To validate these hypotheses, we'll outline experimental methods worth considering.",10,
"We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.","We explore the Coulomb excitation of low-energy states in unstable nuclei during intermediate-energy collisions (with laboratory energies ranging from approximately 10 to 500 MeV per nucleon). Our findings indicate that the cross sections for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) transitions decrease with increasing energy, becoming significantly smaller above 10 MeV/nucleon. However, we observe that both retardation effects and Coulomb distortion play a significant role in these interactions, regardless of whether the energy is as low as 10 MeV/nucleon or as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. These results have important implications for future research at radioactive beam facilities.",7,
"Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs.","Intersection bodies, a fascinating class of geometric objects, are closely linked to sectioning star bodies and utilize Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and related Fourier analysis.

Notably, these bodies encompass $ k $-intersection bodies (as defined by A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces within $ L_p $-spaces. Our research reveals that restricting the spherical Radon transforms and generalized cosine transforms to lower-dimensional subspaces preserves their integral-geometric essence. By applying this insight, we delve into the study of sections of $\ Lam$-intersection bodies, leading to fresh characterizations and illustrative examples. Additionally, we revisit established facts and offer novel proof approaches.",8,
"In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\Theta(m\\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences.","In this study, we present an innovative approach to decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) using the online Viterbi algorithm, which requires significantly less space than traditional methods. Specifically, our analysis shows that the expected maximum memory usage for decoding a sequence of length n with an m-state HMM can be reduced to O(m log n), without sacrificing performance. This represents a substantial improvement over the classical Viterbi algorithm, which necessitates O(mn) space and becomes impractical when dealing with large datasets such as entire human genome chromosomes or continuous data streams. To validate our findings, we have conducted experiments utilizing a simplified HMM for gene discovery on both synthetic and actual DNA sequences, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our novel method.",7,
"Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.","Neutrinoless double beta decay offers a unique opportunity to explore physics beyond the Standard Model without relying on high-energy accelerators.

"We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism. Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\\mu (with \\mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \\theta and \\bar\\theta.

We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski.,"We present a family of rings of symmetric functions, each dependent on an endless sequence of parameters. A set of Schur function analogs serves as a preferred foundation for such a ring. The Littlewood-Richardson polynomials, which are polynomial in the parameters, define the structural constants of this ring. We have devised a combinatorial technique for determining these numbers, which involves altering a previous B. Sagan and author's outcome. This method produces a formula that exhibits the positivity of W. Graham for the polynomials. Using this approach, we calculate the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians, implying a stability feature of the structure factors. Although A. Knutson and T. Tao previously discovered a manifestly positive formula for such an expansion utilizing puzzle combinatorics, they did not notice the stability property. Moreover, we employ the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication law in the Casimir elements' algebra for the general linear Lie algebra, which A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski established using quantum immanents.",10,
"Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.","In the context of Lagrangian quantum theory, this study examines the potential algebraic commutation relationships between scalar, spinor, and vector fields from a mathematical perspective. To determine these relations, we utilize the Heisenberg equations and a specific uniqueness condition for the operators of the dynamic variables. We find that the paracommutation relations, or certain generalizations thereof, are the most comprehensive options that ensure the validity of all Heisenberg equations. However, we encounter an issue where satisfying both the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement simultaneously becomes impossible. To address this challenge, we introduce a redefinition of the dynamic variables, analogous to the normal ordering procedure, which includes the latter as a special case. This modification leads to adjustments in the allowable commutation relations. When considering the concept of vacuum, we restrict the range of feasible commutation relations further, ultimately arriving at the standard bilinear commutation relations as the sole known option that meets all the requirements and does not conflict with available data.",8,
"Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.","Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) hold great promise for use in advanced optoelectronic and electronic devices, including lasers, photodetectors, and nanoscale logic systems. To realize their full potential, it's essential to understand and control the spatial and size orders of SAQDs. This study focuses on understanding the spatial order of SAQDs, which is expected to be closely related to size order. Using a widely employed model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion, we derived analytical formulas for film-height correlation functions that describe the spatial order of SAQDs and quantify the degree of order through correlation lengths. Our results show that initial random fluctuations lead to moderate correlation lengths (on the order of two dots) when the wetting potential has a negligible impact. However, the correlation lengths increase significantly when SAQDs are formed at a critical film height, indicating enhanced ordering. Our findings support previous research highlighting the importance of anisotropy and SAQD order. Moreover, we provide a clear and transparent mechanism for understanding ordering phenomena, accompanied by explicit analytical equations. Notably, SAQD formation is inherently a stochastic process, and our study sheds light on various statistical aspects of SAQD formation and order.",9,

"In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders. It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s), each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE. Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives. The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.","In this study, we introduce a novel approach for obtaining exact solutions to certain types of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method involves breaking down nonlinear operators into a series of simpler operators of lower order, which can be achieved through an iterative process. Each iteration requires the solution of a set of auxiliary PDEs involving a single dependent variable. Notably, we derive an explicit formula for the first-order PDEs corresponding to the first integral of the original decomposable PDE. Interestingly, this first-order PDE turns out to be linear when the initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives. We have implemented our technique in a Maple procedure, which has been successfully applied to various PDEs with differing numbers of independent variables and orders. Several examples are provided to showcase the effectiveness of our method in automatically solving nonlinear PDEs.",10,
"This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita $\\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita $\\alpha$-contexts to $\\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts.","This paper delves into the realm of Morita contexts, specifically focusing on two types: injective Morita contexts, where the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective, and Morita αcontexts, where the connecting bimodules possess local projectivity à la Zimmermann-Huisgen. The authors' motivation stems from scenarios where a single trace ideal is involved or the compatibility between bimodule morphisms is unnecessary. They introduce the concepts of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, which they explore in depth. By utilizing injective Morita data, along with static and adstatic modules, the authors establish connections between various intersecting subcategories associated with subcategories of modules that are localized or co-localized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. Ultimately, the study culminates in applications of Morita αcontexts to *-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts.",8,
