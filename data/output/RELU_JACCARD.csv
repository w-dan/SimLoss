"We present an x-ray spectromicroscopic investigation of single-crystalline magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) and linear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combination with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time. We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in a metallic system.","In this study, we utilize x-ray spectromicroscopy to investigate the properties of single-crystalline magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers grown on Cu(001) substrates. Our approach combines x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and linear dichroism (XMLD) at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). By leveraging the magnetic interaction between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer, we successfully create magnetic domains with differing crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample. Notably, we observe a significant variation in XMLD contrast between these two domain types, which we attribute to the inherent magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the Co layer.

"In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual hadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming from two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect is known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W pairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses were performed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, with negligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and compared to models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappa parameter most compatible with the data was found to be: kappa_{SK-I} = 2.2^{+2.5}_{-1.3} corresponding to the probability of reconnection P_{reco} to be in the range 0.31 < P_{reco} < 0.68 at 68% confidence level with its best value at 0.52.","The study investigated the phenomenon of Color Reconnection in fully hadronic decays of W pairs at LEP using the DELPHI detector.

"Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.","In the context of Lagrangian quantum theory, this study examines the potential algebraic commutation relationships between scalar, spinor, and vector fields from a mathematical perspective. To determine these relations, we utilize the Heisenberg equations and a specific uniqueness condition for the operators of the dynamic variables. We find that the paracommutation relations, or certain generalizations thereof, are the most comprehensive options that ensure the validity of all Heisenberg equations. However, we encounter an issue where satisfying both the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement simultaneously becomes impossible. To address this challenge, we introduce a redefinition of the dynamic variables, analogous to the normal ordering procedure, which includes the latter as a special case. This modification leads to adjustments in the allowable commutation relations. When considering the concept of vacuum, we restrict the range of feasible commutation relations further, ultimately arriving at the standard bilinear commutation relations as the sole known option that meets all the requirements and does not conflict with available data.",8.0,0.26519337016574585,0.9083171243102894,-8.529013633728027

"In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations.

"We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory.

"We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set.","We examine the outcomes of the joint IRAC and MIPS Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region, focusing on identifying genuine young stellar objects (YSOs) amidst the abundant background contamination from extragalactic objects.

The luminosity function of YSOs in Serpens extends down to around a few times 0.001 solar luminosities, assuming a distance of 260 parsecs. However, this lower limit might be influenced by our inability to differentiate YSOs from extragalactic sources rather than the actual absence of YSOs at very low luminosities.

"The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.","The formation of two-dimensional spin-wave waveforms in long, thin strips of ferromagnetic material has been studied using advanced techniques that allow us to observe changes in the magnetic field over time and space.

"Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the universe.

"We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed.

Restricting their attention to tensor fields, the authors explore the implications of this universality property in various contexts. Within the framework of bosonic string theory, they demonstrate that it leads to the existence of a set of world-sheet operators whose correlators remain unchanged under changes in the plane wave's nature or background gauge field. By employing world-sheet conformal field theory, similar conclusions can be reached. Moreover, the authors investigate non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT) and reveal that, under certain conditions, the field redefinition connecting the low-energy effective field theory and CSFT with all massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in the fields. This greatly facilitates identifying the off-shell plane wave solutions on both sides. Additionally, the authors outline an iterative approach for calculating higher massive modes by utilizing the CSFT equations of motion, starting from massless plane wave field configurations. It is worth mentioning that all the findings in the realm of bosonic string theory can be extended to the shared Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.",9.0,0.25316455696202533,0.7224400490417565,-8.508456230163574
"We consider the curvature of a family of warped products of two pseduo-Riemannian manifolds $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$ furnished with metrics of the form $c^{2}g_B \\oplus w^2 g_F$ and, in particular, of the type $w^{2 \\mu}g_B \\oplus w^2 g_F$, where $c, w \\colon B \\to (0,\\infty)$ are smooth functions and $\\mu$ is a real parameter. We obtain suitable expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of such products that allow us to establish results about the existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature structures in these categories. If $(B,g_B)$ is Riemannian, the latter question involves nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with concave-convex nonlinearities and singular partial differential equations of the Lichnerowicz-York type among others.","We investigate the curvature properties of a family of warped product manifolds formed by combining two pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$, with metrics that take the form $c^2g_B \oplus w^2g_F$. Specifically, we focus on the case where the metric has the form $w^{2\mu}g_B \oplus w^2g_F$, where $c, w: B \to (0,\infty)$ are smooth functions and $\mu$ is a real parameter. By deriving appropriate expressions for the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature, we aim to determine whether these warped products admit Einstein or constant scalar curvature structures.

"The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales.","A comprehensive observational campaign spanning several months revealed that the BL Lac object 3C 66A emits energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves, X-rays, and even very high-energy gamma rays. By using a time-dependent leptonic jet model, researchers were able to accurately replicate the observed variations in the object's brightness and energy output. Their analysis showed that the innate gamma-ray emission cap of 3C 66A lies around 4 GeV, and they discovered that the impact of intergalactic infrared background radiation on the object's high-energy emission is minimal. Additionally, the study suggests that a broad line region within 3C 66A plays a crucial role in producing gamma rays when the emission source is near the center of the black hole; however, at greater distances, other mechanisms take over. Finally, the study explores whether X-ray spectral changes can be detected, although the findings indicate that significant patterns are unlikely to occur in the optical or soft X-ray ranges during large flares lasting multiple days.",5.0,0.21363636363636362,0.7224400490417565,-5.734261989593506
"Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.","Partial cubes are subgraphs of hypercubes that share the same symmetries and properties as their parent structure. Semicubes, which are formed by combining smaller cubes, are used to define structures on a graph. Two important concepts in the study of partial cubes are Djokovi's and Winkler's relations.

"We use a driven Monte Carlo dynamics in the phase representation to determine the linear resistivity and current-voltage scaling of a two-dimensional Josephson-junction array at an irrational flux quantum per plaquette. The results are consistent with a phase-coherence transition scenario where the critical temperature vanishes. The linear resistivity is nonzero at any finite temperatures but nonlinear behavior sets in at a temperature-dependent crossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the dynamics of the array. The linear resistivity behavior is consistent with some experimental results on arrays of superconducting grains but not on wire networks, which we argue have been obtained in a current regime above the crossover current.","We utilize a driven Monte Carlo dynamics approach in the phase representation to study the linear resistivity and current-voltage scaling of a two-dimensional Josephson-junction array at an irrational flux quantum per plaquette.

"Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.","Potassium's ability to insert itself into graphite is looked at using first-principles theory. Traditional semi-local density functional theory (DFT) calculations do a good job of explaining the bonding in the potassium-graphite compound. But to figure out how much energy it takes to make an intercalate from pure potassium atoms and graphite, you need a way to describe the binding between the graphite layers that includes non-local dispersive interactions. A van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method does this without any problems and includes these interactions in a natural way along with regular DFT. Using the vdW-DF method makes the graphite crystal more stable, which agrees fairly well with what has been seen in real life. They also say that things like the distance between bindings, the energy it takes to form a layer, and the amount of energy it takes to put potassium under the surface are all affected by the vdW-DF description. Compared to the traditional semilocal approach, the vdW-DF description makes the elastic response less strong.",7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7224400490417565,-0.615354061126709

"Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded.","The topic of lattice contributions to electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides has recently sparked significant interest and debate.
